# SASS Installation Steps:

This documentation explains how I installed sass (version 3.7.4) using node.js and npm on my local machine.


## Prerequisites:

Before installing sass, make sure the following tools are installed:

1. **Node.js:** Sass installation via npm requires Node.js. You can check if node.js is installed by running the code below in your terminal:

   node -v


   If itâ€™s not installed, you can download and install it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm comes bundled with node.js. To confirm it's installed, run:

   npm -v
  

## Installation Steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder:

cd alx-intermediate-frontend/0x03-sass_scss


2. Initialize npm in your project (if not already done): This creates a `package.json` file that will manage your project's dependencies.

npm init -y


3. Install Sass version 3.7.4: Use the command below to install the specified version of Sass:

npm install sass@3.7.4

This will add Sass as a dependency in your `package.json` and store it in the `node_modules` folder.


## Verifying the Installation:

After installation, you can verify that sass has been successfully installed by checking the version:

npx sass --version

If the output shows **3.7.4**, the installation was successful.
